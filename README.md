# ThinkfulCapstone2
For my second capstone at Thinkful, I analyzed a dataset of 1460 homes sold between 2006 and 2010. 
For this project, I determined which properties were deemed good investments and presented my findings to support my recommendations.
I concluded that the following factors in the data were driving home prices:
  1. Overall Quality
  2. Square Footage
  3. Year Remodeled
  4. Year Built
  5. Total Rooms
This project was done in Excel and presented with PowerPoint.
