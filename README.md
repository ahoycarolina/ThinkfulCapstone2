# ThinkfulCapstone2
For my second capstone at Thinkful, I analyzed a dataset of 1460 homes sold between 2006 and 2010. 
For this project, I determined which properties were deemed good investments and presented my findings to support my recommendations.
I concluded that the following factors in the data were driving home prices, based off statistical and A/B testing:
  1. Overall Quality
  2. Square Footage
  3. Year Remodeled
  4. Year Built
  5. Total Rooms
The above factors determined what a property sells for, allowing us to conclude that homes that had been recently remodeled, built more recently, had more rooms, or larger square footage and and better quality are a much better investments than other homes in the dataset that do not meet that criteria.

This project was done in Excel and presented with PowerPoint, and can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_n-95Y8oXxWXWVeLkAgeQXV5AwW_jyOK/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116171400978382865775&rtpof=true&sd=true).
